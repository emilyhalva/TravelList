# Travel List

### This project is a component of [The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/?couponCode=24T6MT62024) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann). The website's design and structure were provided as part of the course curriculum, and I did not create the website from the ground up. The main objective of this project is to reinforce and implement the concepts covered throughout the course.

## Description

The Travel List App is designed to help travelers efficiently organize and manage their packing lists for upcoming trips. Users can easily create a list of items they need to pack, specify the quantity of each item using a drop-down menu ranging from 1 to 20, and keep track of their packed items by toggling a check mark. Additionally, the app offers sorting options that allow users to filter their packing list alphabetically, by packed status, or by the order in which items were added.

## Features

- **Create Packing List:** Users can enter items they need to pack for their trip in the text input area.
- **Specify Quantity:** When adding an item, users may choose the quantity of each item using a drop-down menu ranging from 1 to 20.
- **Delete Item:** Deletes an item from the current packing list.
- **Track Packed Items:** Mark items as packed by toggling a check mark.
- **Sorting Options:**
  - Sort items alphabetically.

## Learning Objectives

During the development of this app, I achieved several learning objectives:

- **Understanding useState:** I gained proficiency in using the useState hook to manage state within functional components, allowing for dynamic updates and interactions within the app.

- **Exploring React Components:** I learned how to effectively structure and utilize React components to modularize functionality and improve code organization.

- **Implementing Conditional Rendering:** I practiced implementing conditional rendering techniques to display components based on different states and user interactions.

- **Handling Form Input:** I gained experience in handling forms and actions, such as onSubmit events, within the React framework.

These learning objectives helped me deepen my understanding of React fundamentals and improve my skills in building interactive and responsive web applications.
